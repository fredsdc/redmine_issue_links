= Redmine Issue Links plugin

This plugin adds a link left of the other issue links (Edit, Copy), that creates a subtask of a specific tracker.

It adds shortcuts for when your users don't know how Redmine works.

== How to use

Members with permission to edit the project would find in settings a new tab "Issue Links".

Fill a name for the link, and the trackers (parent and child) that the plugin would use.

Save.
